## Project Description
> This project involves the development of a data centralization system for a multinational retail chain. The primary goal is to automate the extraction, cleaning, and storage of sales data from various sources, including RDS databases, S3 buckets, and JSON files. This system enhances data accessibility and reliability, significantly improving decision-making processes. Through this project, I've deepened my understanding of Python, SQL, AWS services, and data engineering principles.
